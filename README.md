# Assignment #2 (SMU Data Analytics Boot Camp 2023) README

## Background
"You are well on your way to becoming a programmer and Excel expert! In this homework assignment, you will use VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data."

## Files
[Here](https://static.bc-edx.com/data/dl-1-2/m2/lms/starter/Starter_Code.zip) is the skeleton I was given to work with before designing my code.

## Instructions
Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:

- The ticker symbol
- Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
- The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
- The total stock volume of the stock. The result should match the following image:

- Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume". The solution should match the following image:

- Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once.

## Results

I have included screenshots indicating the results of each given year per worksheet within the workbook, as well as the stock_analysis macro utilized for running the code.
